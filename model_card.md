# Model Card 

## Model Description

**Input:** Describe the inputs of your model 

The inputs of the model consists of the following features, associated with an individual's demographic and past borrowing behaviour:

 1. RevolvingUtilizationOfUnsecuredLines (FLOAT): Total balance on credit cards and personal lines of credit except real estate and no installment debt like car loans divided by the sum of credit limits
 2. Age (INT): Age of borrowers in years
 3. NumberOfTime30-59DaysPastDueNotWorse (INT): Number of times borrower has been 30-59 days past due but no worse in the last 2 years.
 4. DebtRatio (FLOAT): Monthly debt payments, alimony,living costs divided by monthy gross income
 5. MonthlyIncome (FLOAT): Individual's monthly income
 6. NumberOfOpenCreditLinesAndLoans (INT): Number of Open loans
 7. NumberOfTimes90DaysLate (INT): Number of times borrower has been 90 days or more past due.
 8. NumberRealEstateLoansOrLines (INT): Number of mortgage and real estate loans including home equity lines of credit
 9. NumberOfTime60-89DaysPastDueNotWorse (INT): Number of times borrower has been 60-89 days past due but no worse in the last 2 years.
 10. NumberOfDependents (INT): Number of dependents in family excluding themselves (spouse, children etc.)

**Output:** Describe the output(s) of your model

The output of the model consists of a binary classification of either 1 or 0, where "1" represents the fact the individual a person experienced 90 days past due delinquency or worse. This classification is based on the predicted probabilities that each class belongs to. 

**Model Architecture:** Describe the model architecture youâ€™ve used]

The model uses a Random Forest Classifier. Random forest (RF) models make output predictions by combining outcomes from a sequence of regression decision trees. Below shows a sample architecture of how one of the estimator tree in a random forest looks like. This is merely for illustration purposes.

## Performance

To recap, based on business strategy, our model should have a low false postive rate, as we only want to block those whom we are very confident belongs in the positive class. Thus, we want to identify as many true positives as possible. As we have other downstream underwriting risk strategies, we are less concerned about false negatives, as they will be captured later on.

In order to assess the model's performance, we used the following metrics as summarized below. Also, as we are using the underlying predicted probabilities of each class, we set the threshold for defining the positive class. The summary table below uses the default threshold of 0.5. 

**Here we present the summary metrics of the Random Forest Model trained on different data:**
1. Normal Model - Random Forest Model trained on normal training data with no oversampling.
2. Oversampled Model - Random Forest Model trained on training data generated from oversampling

**EVALUATION METRICS SUMMARY TABLE (NORMAL) - Model trained on non-oversampled data**

| Evaluation Metric | Training Data | Test Data |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Accuracy  | 0.93587  | 0.93438  |
| ROC-AUC  | 0.851 | 0.85383  |
| Sensitivity  | 0.01388  | 0.01042  |
| Specificity  | 0.99989  | 0.99927  |
| Precision-Recall (class 0)  | 0.935-0.999  | 0.935-0.999  |
| Precision-Recall (class 1)  | 0.500-0.010  | 0.500-0.010  |

**EVALUATION METRICS SUMMARY TABLE (OVERSAMPLING) - Model trained on oversampled data**

| Evaluation Metric | Training Data | Test Data |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Accuracy  | 0.74012  | 0.74299  |
| ROC-AUC  | 0.85023 | 0.85814  |
| Sensitivity  | 0.79958  | 0.79167  |
| Specificity  | 0.73592  | 0.73958 |
| Precision-Recall (class 0)  | 0.981-0.736  | 0.981-0.740  |
| Precision-Recall (class 1)  | 0.176-0.800  | 0.176-0.792  |

Based on the above, the overall better performing model is the one that is trained on the oversampled data. Although, it has a lower accuracy on the test set, it outperforms the model trained on non-oversampled data in terms of recall. Recall is important to our business strategy as we want to correctly identify individuals in the positive class, given that they are will be 90 days dpd. The model trained on oversampled data also has a more balanced sensitivity and specificity as compared to the model trained on non-oversampled data.


## Limitations

Outline the limitations of your model.

The limitations of the model is that it can only predict that the person experiences a 90 days past due delinquency or worse. As this is a classification model, it only gives a binary output and we cannot predict the actual number of days past due. Also, random forest models are prone to overfitting and while it will perform well on this dataset, one should be cautious about its accuracy.

## Trade-offs

Outline any trade-offs of your model, such as any circumstances where the model exhibits performance issues. 

The above limitation of overfitting in random forest models can lead to performance issues, as the model may suffer in terms of classification accuracy when predicting on newer and more updated data. There is need to retrain the model should we wish to introduce more updated data for prediction. Also the model has a high precision and low recall. Therefore, one needs to be aware of performance issues arriving from potential false negatives, and there needs to be additional strategies to deal with these edge cases
